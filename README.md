To ensure efficient management of employee leaves, it is imperative that every company implements a leave management system that tracks and records each employee's time off. My task was to create a website that automates the annual leave management process, making it easier for both employees and employers to manage and monitor leave.

The website includes the following features:

   1- A display of all employee leave requests, including the type of leave, requested period, and status (approved, rejected, or pending).

   2- Online handling of leave management applications.

   3- A schedule of bank holidays.
